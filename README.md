# VO HUB interface for QGIS

 This repoistory contains two folders:
   PS_API contains python code snippets to compose RASDAMAN queries. 
   VOScriptReceiver contains a QGIS plugin to recieve SAMP messages from VO HUB.
 
This way data from any of the VO tools (Aladin, CASSIS, etc.) can be sent to QGIS with interop services.

This repo is for making a VO HUB interface for QGIS using primarily astropy.vo.samp module.
