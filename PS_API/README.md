Here is the python API for generating Planet Server RASDAMAN WCPS Queries.

There are two files: ps_wcps_api.py contains code for generating queries

ps_wcps_viviano.py contains example queries as per Viviano-Becks.

To load the image use form based query interface (rather than URL - could be too long)
